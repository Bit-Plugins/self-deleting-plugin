<h1>Self-Deleting Plugin</h1>
Self-Deleting bot was a social experiment we ran in August 2023. <br>
The basic premise was that the bot would pick a random number between 1 and 5000, if a player guess correct, the bot would delete itself entirely <br><br>
This time, the bot will select a number between 1 and 10,000 and shuffle itself every 3 hours <i>with a 20% chance of not shuffling itself.</i>

Yes, in fact that'll be the primary method of use.<br><br>

Unsure.
